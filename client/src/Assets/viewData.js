    problem:
      "dummy: I have this JS code that I use to add and remove a class while scrolling down from the top of a page, but what I want is to do is also disappear when you come close to the end of the page or go back to its old state after some scrolling (from right: 7px to right: -150px, for example). I copied the same JS code and changed the scrollTop, scrollBottom and it didnt work.",

        "dummy: Some model objects in R require native serialization methods to be saved and reloaded from file—h2o objects (and thus the tidymodels objects that wrap them) are an example of one that does. The tidymodels and vetiver teams at Posit recently collaborated on a package, bundle, that provides a consistent interface to native serialization methods. The docs on h2o are here.",
